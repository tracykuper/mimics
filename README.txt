Simulation files for Multi-scale model of Metabolism In Cellular Systems (MiMICS) that can be used to integrate -omics-guided metabolic models and predict multi-scale metabolism in microbial communities.MIMICS.java: contains the Cell3D agent class and MIMICS class. Contains methods to simulate an agent-based model and a reaction-diffusion model. Contains methods to save MiMICS agent and metabolite concentration outputs.  Executed in Java.MIMICS_gateway.java: contains methods to start the Py4J Gateway Server, which interfaces MiMICS files written in Java and Python languages. Also contains methods to automatically start the MiMICS python file, agents_FBA.py, if desired. Executed in Java.agents_FBA.py: optimizes each agent’s metabolic model. Contains functions to initialize the MiMICS agent and metabolite grids, pass agent information between the metabolic model (Python) and HAL (Java) using the Py4J Gateway Server, and run agent-based model and metabolite diffusion methods using the Py4J Gateway Server. Executed in python.MiMICS User Manual.docx: User manual describing how to run MiMICS simulations.
